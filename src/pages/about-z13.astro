          People have been watching the stars ever since ... well, ever since there have been people.
          And over time, people learned to see the connections between the patterns in the sky and the patterns in their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, the accumulated wisdom of the star knowledge (<em>astro logos</em> in Greek) 
          was distilled into a system of signs and symbols. And the knowledge was standardized and codified
          into the tropical zodiac that we know and love today.

          Two problems, though - one was a small shift that happened over time, and the other was a big omission.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The small shift</strong> was the precession of the equinoxes, which is a slow wobble in Earth's rotation. 
          As a result, the constellations are about 23.5 degrees off from where they were 2,000 years ago. <em>Oops!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The big omission</strong> was the omission of an entire sign, Ophiuchus.
          The serpent bearer. The 13th sign in the zodiac, omitted because it made the math harder.
          <em>Uh oh!</em>

          Neither of these changes makes Tropical astrology "wrong."
          It simply means the sky tells more than one version of the story, and Z13 Astrology has both the Tropical and True-Sky Sidereal zodiacs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Z13 exists to let you explore both
          the symbolic zodiac you know,
          and the star-aligned zodiac above your head.
