        <p>It started with a throwaway comment from a friend.</p>
        <p>
          One of those comments that comes up after the second Americano during a Sunday morning <span class="italic text-gray-300">bear your soul</span> kind of coffee date. 
          I was yapping on about how I was at a phase in my life when everything seemed to be shifting -
          old layers being shed, new ones being built. She tilted her head and said,
          <span class={gradient}>"Sounds like your Saturn return is hitting hard."</span>
        </p>
        <p>I blinked. "My what?"</p>
        <p>
          I'd never really been into astrology. Horoscope columns seemed to fit like
          off-the-rack clothing - kind of, but not really. But she was an old soul,
          and something about the way she said it - with that knowing glint -
          pulled me in.

      <!-- Section 2 -->
      <section class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-lg md:text-xl">
        <p>So I started poking around.</p>
        <p>
          Looked up my birth chart on a few of the big astrology sites. Found Saturn.
          Found the dates. Started tracking. It was interesting, sure ...
          but something didn't quite click.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's when my friend said:
          <span class={gradient}>
            "You're a Scorpio in tropical. But I'd bet your Sun's actually in Libra,
            or maybe Virgo. They both fit your energy. <br />
            You should check sidereal -
            it uses the real sky."
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Wait. Real sky?</strong></p>

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <section class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-lg md:text-xl">
        <p>I had no idea what she meant - but I looked it up.</p>
        <p>
          I pulled a sidereal chart. I ran the data. I checked <a href="https://stellarium-web.org/" target="_blank">Stellarium</a> to check out the actual star map for the
          day I was born.
        </p>
        <p class="font-semibold">
          And sure enough - the Sun was in Virgo. Not Scorpio. Not even close.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cue the existential double take.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I dove deeper, something lit up. I started comparing the actual sky
          placements of my planets with my personality and events in my real life. </p>
          <p class="font-semibold">
          It wasn't just "kind of accurate."
        </p>
        <p class="italic text-gray-300">It was uncannily true!</p>

      <!-- Section 4 -->
      <section class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-lg md:text-xl">
        <p>
          Patterns emerged. My whole life started making more sense - not in a
          deterministic "<span class="italic text-gray-300">on Thursday, you be near water when you meet a new person who will change your life</span>" way.
          More of a soul-map kind of way like when you have a friend who just gets you without you having to explain yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's when I had to hand in my astrology skeptic badge. Because
          whatever this was ... it worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Better than any MBTI or Enneagram. More nuanced than any personality test.
          This was alive. Cosmic. Deep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I got curious. (Of course I did - I'm a Virgo!)

      <!-- Section 5 -->
      <section class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-lg md:text-xl">
        <p>
          I found out that the zodiac used by most of Western astrology -
          <strong>the tropical zodiac</strong> - was frozen in time over
          2,000 years ago. It no longer lines up with the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to <strong>precession</strong> (a slow wobble in Earth's rotation),
          everything had shifted by about 23.5 degrees. Which means ... <br />
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold text-xl">
          The signs we've been taught? They don't match the sky anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I went further back. Into older systems. Ancient skywatchers.
          Real-sky astrology before it got simplified and standardized.
        </p>

        <p class="font-semibold">
          And that's when I found the 13th sign.

        The Serpent Bearer - long omitted because he didn't fit the 12-sign grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out, the signs aren't evenly spaced. Some - like Virgo -
          stretch 45 degrees wide. Others, like Scorpio, only cover 7.
        </p>
        <p class="italic text-gray-300">
          The sky doesn't care about neat geometry.  
          It tells the truth as it is.

      <!-- Section 6 -->
      <section class="space-y-6 leading-relaxed text-lg md:text-xl pb-16">
        <p>So I brought it all together, in a way that was very much true to my Virgo nature: <br />

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-gray-300">
          <li>Sidereal signs based on the actual constellations</li>
          <li>True boundaries not rounded off for convenience</li>
          <li>Precise astronomical data because the stars deserve it</li>
          <li>And yeah ... a <strong>13th house</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Because when you start seeing the whole cycle, there's a space beyond endings.  
          A place of synthesis.  
          And it felt right.

        <p>Does this mean that sidereal astrology is more "true" than tropical astrology?</p>

        <p>
          Not at all. Both are mirrors that cast a reflection of you from different angles.<br /> 
         Both provide guidance and insight. Take a look at both, and choose the guide that feels right for you.</p>  
        <p class="italic text-gray-300">But for me, sidereal astrology feels like a better fit. Especially the Z13 style that 
            views the real sky and the actual constellations as the starting point of understanding. </p>
